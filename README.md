ECMAScript 6(ECMAScript 2015) is the sixth version of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that defines the JavaScript programming language.

<i>ES6 brought several new features and syntax enhancements to JavaScript, including:

1. Block-scoped variables: The let and const keywords were introduced to declare variables with block-level scope, improving variable scoping and reducing common issues.
2. Arrow functions: A concise syntax for defining functions using the => arrow operator, which simplifies function definitions and lexical scoping.
3. Template literals: An easier way to create strings with embedded expressions using backticks ( ), allowing multiline strings and variable interpolation.
4. Destructuring assignment: A syntax that allows extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables, making it more convenient to work with complex data structures.
5. Default parameters: The ability to define default values for function parameters, making it easier to handle missing or undefined values.
6. Classes: The introduction of class syntax for creating objects and defining object-oriented programming structures, including constructors, methods, and inheritance.
7. Modules: A standardized module system for organizing and sharing code, allowing developers to export and import functions, objects, or values between different JavaScript files.
8. Promises: A built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner and more structured way to work with asynchronous code.
9. Iterators and generators: Iterators enable custom iteration behaviors, while generators allow creating functions that can pause and resume their execution, providing a powerful tool for working with sequences and asynchronous operations.</i>
